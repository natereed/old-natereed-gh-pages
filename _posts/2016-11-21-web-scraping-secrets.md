On my to-do list is to write a book about all I know on the topic of web scraping.  ["Web Scraping Secrets"](http://www.webscrapingsecrets.com) will cover the use of the Python Scrapy framework, as well as more advanced topics like headless browsers and PhantomJS. It's a "living" document, as I imagine I'll want to update it as time goes on.
